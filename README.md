# xubuntu-x2go-phusion
A Docker image as a Xubuntu VM with X2Go server inheriting from phusion/baseimage

I built this Xubuntu VM for trying out build systems that might bork my main machine.

It takes ideas from ```paimpozhil/docker-x2go-xubuntu``` but starts from ```phusion/baseimage``` instead of official ```ubuntu``` image.

Detailed instructions to follow soon. Meanwhile, please look at : [xubuntu-x2go-phusion on GitHub](https://github.com/warehouseman/xubuntu-x2go-phusion)
